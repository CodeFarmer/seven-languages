- syntactically significant indentation FTW
- if is an expression, not a statement

- like Erlang, structuring and destructuring are symmetrical

* Dislike

- It has the list comma thing

* Day 1

- The IO action ‘main’ is not defined in module ‘Main’
  - it's a FAQ though

- factorial(50000) is blazing fast
  - factorial(5000) is instantaneous

- guards... not sure what I think about those, but do they help with thinking about Erlang?

- _ for "don't care" seems to be universal

- passing accumulators around in tuples is idiomatic?
  - the Clojure multi-arg loop is analogous, but somehow nicer to me

- (h:t)

- lists being homogeneous
  - can't add a String to a list if Ints
  - but if you add a float to a list of ints, you get a *list of floats*
  - would have been cooler to expand the type of a new list to literally anything
    - maybe not possible mathematically to find the "smallest enclosing type" like that?

- list comprehensions don't have to just comprehend lists
  - take 5 [x*2 | x <- [1..]]
