* Like

- everything is right there if you look:
> $ 
$ 
$ Lobby getSlot("exit")
$ CLI slotNames
$ CLI prompt := "% "

* Dislike

* Day 1

$ Object slotNames
  - looks like there's a whole async actor system in there

- if... how do you do else?

- Maps and Lists are mutable (atPut append etc)

- [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Io_Programming/Io_Style_Guide][Style guide]]

- 0 is truthy

- ::= creates a setter

- foo say := method("moo" println)
- foo getSlot("say") call
  - found by 'method proto slotNames' :)

- so far: it's amazing how much you can figure out without reading the
  docs, once you know about Object, Lobby and slotNames
