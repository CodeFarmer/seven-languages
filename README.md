* Seven Languages

Our book club at [Expedia Partner Solutions](https://www.expediapartnersolutions.com/) London is working our way through Bruce Tate's [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).

Each week I'll put my chapter homework (or at least, the interesting
bits) and notes in here.
