* Like

- Super good Emacs integration
  - M-x erlang-shell out of the box

- List literals, tuples and atoms are always nice
- since the book, Erlang has gained map literals too

* Dislike

- Oh my God the error messages
  - It's like Prolog but without the conceptual lens

- Associative arrays as lists of pairs is so oldskool
  - modern Erlang has sorted this out: #[ 1 => 2 , a => 4 ]
  - Common Lisp :P

* Day 1

- the pattern of having a type atom at the beginning of a tuple is interesting
- Taily goodness

* Day 2


* Day 3
