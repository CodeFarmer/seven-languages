- \+ for "not" gahh
- ; for logical-or

* Day 1

- Using SWI Prolog on Mac
  - Some things are different, but it's OK so far
  - 'a' for "all solutions" doesn't work
  - looking at the manual, looks like there's a lot more going on here
    than just a database thingy. Coroutines, TTY interface calls,
    JSON, HTTP...
  - Machine Learning tutuorial
  - PlDoc!!!

- Error reporting takes some getting used to but it works

- So far not clear on "writing facts" vs "querying facts", they look
  the same syntactically...
  - they are the same
  - consult(...) vs query execution
    - see also listing(...)

- Have only typed := instead of :- about a dozen times in the first hour
  - "Full stop in clause-body?  Cannot redefine ,/2"

- colouring(Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida).

- "An Interview With Brian Tarbox, Dolphon Researcher".
  - Hahahahahahahaha
  - Can't tell you where the overconstraint is or offer partial
    solution

- Didn't do the exercises as they were the same as the examples (maybe
  not expected to do the xamples interactively?)

* Day 2

- Oh hooray, recursive lists. And we're back in my LISPy comfort zone :)

* Day 3
